              As you embark on this well-deserved retirement, we want you to know how profoundly 
              you've impacted our lives. Your passion for teaching didn't just show us how to 
              code, but taught us to think outside the box, solve complex problems, and embrace lifelong learning. 
              Most importantly, you instilled in us the values of professionalism and excellence in everything we create.

              Through countless hours of patient guidance, from debugging our first "Hello World" programs 
              to tackling advanced topics, you've shaped not just our technical skills but our character. 
              Your enthusiasm was spread to everyone in the class, your dedication unwavering, and your belief in our potential 
              made all the difference. You didn't just teach computer science, you taught us how to look at a problem beyond just a screen, most importanly 
              visualize it too.

              Your classroom was more than a place of learning â€“ it was where curiosity expanded, 
              where mistakes became stepping stones, and where impossible seemed achievable. 
              You celebrated our accomplishments from making it to World Vex Robotics, to encouraged us through challenges, 
              and always gave us the hard time so we never settle for less.
